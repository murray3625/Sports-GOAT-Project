# Understanding the Factors Associated with French Elementary School Student Test Scores

by Matthew Murray

## Project Summary

For this project, I used multilevel models to understand the factors associated with French elementary school students' performance on end-of-year standardized tests in math and French. The dataset I used to fit my model contains various student and classroom-specific variables. Overall, my model provides evidence that suggests that French elementary school students who have repeated a grade tend to perform worse on end-of-year math and French standardized exams compared to students who have not. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that students who perform better on beginning-of-year tests tend to perform better on end-of-year tests. More broadly, the model suggests that student-specific characteristics tend to be more strongly associated with academic performance than classroom-specific factors.
